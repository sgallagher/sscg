Description: simple SSL certificate generator
 sscg is a utility to aid in the creation of more secure "self-signed"
 certificates. The certificates created by this tool are generated in a
 way so as to create a CA certificate that can be safely imported into a
 client machine to trust the service certificate without needing to set
 up a full PKI environment and without exposing the machine to a risk of
 false signatures from the service certificate.
